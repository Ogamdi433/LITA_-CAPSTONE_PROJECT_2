# LITA_PROJECT_CAPSTONE-2

### Project Title: Customer Segementation for a Subscription Service

### Project Overview

This customer segementation analysis aims to identify distinct groups within the subscription service and customer subscription type, enabling data-driven decisions to enhance customer experiences, optimize marketing strategies and increase oveerall subscription value.

### Data sources.

The primary sources of this project inludes; customer relationship management (CRM) system, customeer database and mobile app or web analytics tools.

### Tools used

the tools used for this project are;
-  Microsoft excel for data cleaning
-  SQL for query writing
-  Powerbi for visualization and
-  Github for documentation


### Data cleaning
data cleaning involves several processes. to ensure data accuracy, completeness and consistency, here is a step-by-step process.
-  handling missing files
-  identify missing values (e.g, NULL, blank, NA).
-  decide on replacement stategies (e.g, mean, median, imputation).
-  replace missing values
-  data normalization
-  standardize date formats
-  convert categorical variables into numerical variables
-  error detection and correction data transformation

 ### exploratory data analysis (EDA)
  EDA involves examining and summarizing data to understand patterns, trends and corrections. here is a comprehensive EDA checklist.
-  what are the top-selling products/category
-  which regions/territories generate most most sales
-  how do sales vary by season/holiday
-  which customer segments drive most sales
-  what marketing channels are most effective

  ### Data Analysis

  ### EXCEL

1.  Here, i'm going to analyze the customer data using pivot tables to find the subscription patterns.

### subscription distribution by region

![subscription by region](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6287b94c-026a-486f-8631-fa81f28b13a4)

This pivot table explains the regions that have the most subscribers and the subsription type that are popular in each region.


### subscription growth over time

![subscription growth](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0858b4e-21a5-4a98-8a3f-a4604cf60dcf)

This pivot table above explains how subscription growth vary by month/quarter and how subscription types have steady growth.

### Cancelation Rates

![cancelation rate](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c29932f-d0ee-4955-8e8b-7780791aec0a)

This explains the subsription types that have higher cancelation rates.


### Revenue Analysis.


![revenue](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/509b05da-a67a-4dc6-9726-dcbc8bf421c0)


This table shows the sum of revenue generated by custmers in each region


2. Here, i'm going to calculate the average subscription duration and identify the most popular types


### average subscription duration

![avg subsription duration](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c225f6fb-1999-427d-9e66-dbbe3328c353)

The above table explains how long customers typically subscribe


### Popular subscription type


![popular sub type](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52b2016c-f00f-48cf-8b37-28c84e187913)


Given the explanation of this table above, the popular subscription type is BASIC because it has the hihest number of subscribers.


3.  here, i will calculate the percentage of revenue generated by each region

![revenue %](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31bb5e8e-bdd9-430e-ad70-4d8cf12e7ba9)

The table above shows the percentage generated by each region


### SQL (Structured Query Language)


1.  here, i'm going to retrieve the no of customers from each region

     ```SQL
        SELECT region, COUNT (customerid) AS total_customers
        FROM [dbo]. [lita_project 2]
        GROUP BY region
        ```

     
 2.  here, i will find the most popular subscription type by the no of customers.

       ```SQL
           SELECT TOP 1 subscriptiontype, COUNT (customerid) AS number_ of_ customers
           FROM [dbo]. [lita _project 2]
           GROUP BY subscriptiontype
           ORDER BY number_ of_ customers
           ```

3.  here, i will find customers who canceled their subscription within 6 months.

      ```SQL
         SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [dbo]. [lita_project 2]
         WHERE canceled = 1
          AND
         DATEDIFF(month, subscriptionstart, subscriptionend) <= 6
         ```

4.  here, i will calculate the average subscription duration for all customers.


     ```SQL
        SELECT AVG(subscription duration) AS average_subscription duration
        FROM [dbo]. [lita_project]
        ```


 5.  here, i will find customers with subscriptions longer than 12 months

      ```SQL
          SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [dbo]. [lita_project 2)
          WHERE
           DATEDIFF(month, subscriptionstart, subscriptionend) >12
            ```

6.  here, i will calculatetotal revenue by subscription type.

     ```SQL
         SELECT subscriptiontype, SUM(revenue) AS total_revenue
         FROM [dbo]. [lita_project 2]
         GROUP BY subscriptiontype
          ```

7.  here, i will find the top 3 regions by subscription cancelations.

     ``` SQL
         SELECT TOP 3 region, COUNT(*) AS cancelation_count
         FROM [dbo]. [lita_project 2]
         WHERE canceled = 1
         GROUP BY region
         ORDER BY cancelation_count DESC
          ```



8.  Here, i will find the total no of active and canceled subscriptions.

   #### Active subscribers

         ```SQL
            SELECT COUNT (*)
            FROM [dbo]. [lita_project 2]
            WHERE canceled =0
             ```


   #### Canceled subscribers


          ```SQL
             SELECT COUNT(*)
             FROM [dbo]. [lita_project 2]
             WHERE canceled = 1
             ```
   

### Power Bi

Here, i'm going to build a powerbi dashboard that visualizes key customer segments, cancelations and subscription trends with slicers for interactive analysis

### customer segments

This picture above explains customer trends with their subsription type and their region with a slicer for a better analysis

### Cancelation trends

This pie chart explains the cancelation trends of subscribers with slicers showing the active and canceled subscriber for more analysis


### Subscription trends


![subscription trends](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7bc92d8-0bf7-4b5d-a384-3eb21a3ad3ac)
